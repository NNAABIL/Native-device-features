# nativefeatures_app

A new Flutter application.

1-- in this app I used google maps to get user current location by using lication plugin
2--I used google maps also to choose location on maps by using google_maps_flutter plugin
and convert it to readable address by geocoding 
3-- I stored my data in local database(title - image - latitude - longitude - address) in device by using sqflite pakage 
4-- I used image_picker pakage to take photo and get its path by using path and path_provider pakages
